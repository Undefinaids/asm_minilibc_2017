# asm_minilibc_2017

This is a project I did at school in order to learn assembly (x86_64).
It aims at reproduce some functions of the C standard library
There is :
- memcpy
- memmove
- memset
- read
- rindex
- strcasecmp
- strchr
- strcmp
- strcspn
- strlen
- strncmp
- strpbrk
- strstr
- write

And in bonus
- a strcat that allocate memory (it concatenates 2 char* into a new one)
- getnextline (getline function)
- strcpy
- strdup
